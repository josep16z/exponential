> 💡 **TL;DR** –  I'm a product engineer based in Barcelona. I've managed Product teams, taken startups from 0 to 1, and developed and shipped dozens of products. Over time, I've acquired a core, niche skillset in AI, crypto, and fintech. Currently, I run Autological, a small product agency that specializes in building AI systems. I read tons of sci-fi and enjoy meditating / wondering about consciousness.

## About Josep

I'm a true generalist at heart, but "product engineer" sums it up 80% well enough and is more easily understood. Even though my formal background is in product management, I've developed and launched dozens of products over the past few years. Currently, I run Autological, a small product agency that specializes in building AI systems for a variety of companies. Before that I led Product at Senken, where we went from 0 to becoming one of the largest carbon credit marketplaces in the world, surpassing powerhouses like Stripe Climate and Watershed.

### Main Achievements

- **Head of Product @ Senken**. World's [top 3](carbonherald.com/top-10-carbon-removal-marketplaces-in-2024/) carbon removal platform by volume.
- **Built Notemates**, which saved $260k/y for client in the healthcare industry.
- **Co-Founder & CEO @ Cosora.** The AI that helps you live more sustainably.
- **Honorific Distinction** awarded by the Government of Catalonia for scoring in the Top 1% of the Spanish University Entrance Examinations (PAU).

## How I Work

- **Gets me pumped:** Building at the cutting edge of tech. Seeing "number go up" with the team.
- **Disappoints me:** Not caring about one's craft/work. Disorganized, sloppy codebases. Big egos.
- **Strengths:** I ship fast. I can go into extreme detail or keep it high-level. I have good product taste (or so I like to think).
- **Improvement points:** Sometimes I'm too agreeable to the point where I struggle to assert when something isn't working for me.
- **Known behaviours / comms style:** My hot take: meetings with >5 participants where participation is required/expected from everybody rarely work. Instead, break them down into smaller groups or make them a webinar-style presentation.

### Some personal stuff

- I'm a huge sci-fi buff. I've been (slowly) writing (and re-writing) my own novel for 10 years now. It involves an AI with Alzheimer's, a big talking toad, cryobabies, and a fungus that takes up the entire northern half of Mars.
- I have been exploring consciousness a lot lately. My current thesis is panpsychic: I believe that consciousness is a fundamental substance of reality and _everything_ is aware (not necessarily self-aware or capable of thought) at all levels.
- I believe healthy societies are those where you can scold a stranger's kid when they're being an a**hole.
- I turned $500 to $100k+ during the NFT mania of 2021-22. Then I fumbled it back to $20k when the music stopped.
- I'm an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality).

### My vision

I've been at this startup game for a while, and while I definitely cannot say I haven't had any form of success, I'm yet to experience my true breakout moment. I'm looking to find a cracked group of like-minded peers to chase that breakout with. If there's one place in the world to do that, it's SF; the talent density and culture there is unmatched.
